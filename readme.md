Technologies used:

We Angular, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to construct our frontend site and a separate Rails backend API to serve our JSON data.  

Project description:
We started this project with a simple idea - YouTube is a valuable tool when learning new skills.  The problem with Youtube is how many videos are available.  Finding high quality and recent videos can be a chore, but with Curated Learningâ„¢ it can be as simple as click, watch, learn!  Our website features a curated list of relevant and recent videos all about learning to code.  Users can create a playlist of their favorite videos and search by difficulty or programming language.

Issues:
An unsolved problem is that when two update forms are open at the same time the user's input appears as though it is going into both forms. Currently, the way to add videos to a playlist is to put the video and playlist id into a form and create a ledger associating the two by their ids. Given more time, we would like to identify the videos based on the video and playlist name. In the future we might also display which playlist(s) lessons belong to. The next course of action would be to expand the site to include more topics of learning available on YouTube (guitar, piano, how to do your taxes, etc..)
